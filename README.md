# TailwindCSS + Tachyons Plugins

I love both of these utilities and I need them to be the same utility. Building out plugins as I happen to need them.

These are modular and can be used individually, in combination, or all together.

Will hopefully put up on npm once I've built some more.

  - `tracked`, `tracked-tight`, `tracked-mega`
- tailwindcss-tachyons/measure
  - `measure`, `measure-wide`, `measure-narrow`, `indent`, `uppercase-small`, `truncate`
- tailwindcss-tachyons/line-height
  - `lh-solid`, `lh-title`, `lh-copy`

  - `h1`-`h5`, `h-25`, `h-50`, `h-75`, `h-100`, `vh-25`, `vh-50`, `vh-75`, `vh-100`
